        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> A year or two ago, I enrolled into a marketing class/club. 
        It was called the SIFMA class, which I think stood for ‚ÄúSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association‚Äù class. 
        There, I learned about marketing, stocks, what they are used for, and how to read stocks. 
        We were also taught on how to look for good stocks, whether it is for the long run, or only for a short period of time. 
        During this time, we, me and the others in the class, competed in a stocks competition that was world wide, 
        with hundreds of thousands of teams and competitors, and it was a competition to see who could raise the most amount of money. 
        You were given a limited amount of fake money, and you were supposed to invest them into stocks, which were actually real time stocks. 
        This means that if the stocks you invested in went down in real time, then yours also went down. 
        It was a competition to see who was best with their money and who actually raised the most money.<br><br>

        I actually didn‚Äôt know anything about stocks coming into this class, but I learned a whole lot about them going forward. 
        My team invested in stocks which were well known, such as Tesla, NVIDIA, Apple, and etc. We also invested in stocks that I have never heard of before, 
        but were actually really good. This competition lasted around a couple of weeks, but we didn‚Äôt do too bad. 
        We were not losing too much money, but we weren‚Äôt raising a lot either. That is when we were taught to look at our stocks data. 
        Meaning the data from years of stocks, to see if there were more pros than cons, to see if there were more money made than money lost, 
        and this actually helped out a lot. We could see how much a stock made within a month, a year, to even 5 years. 
        We saw the linear lines, to see if they made more than they lost, and if they lost money, we researched 
        why they lost money. <br><br>

        Doing a lot of research eventually led us to change our stocks, and to invest smartly with a plan instead of going in blind. 
        During the first few weeks, our team was not doing that well. We were ranked close to last, but as soon as we researched our stocks, 
        we were actually able to see some improvements. I was able to see our improvements. I saw that our teams rose in ranks, and by the end, 
        our team was ranked top 30 globally. This shocked us, and this also shocked our teacher, because of how well we did. 
        After all this ended, It eventually led to me researching more about stocks. 
        Later on, I even convinced my parents to invest in stocks as well, such as Apple, Tesla, etc., and 
        they actually started to make more money. For now, I am not investing too much because I 
        do not have much money, but by the time of next year, I will have accumulated enough knowledge 
        from my research and I will invest more in stocks, from which I hope to make more money.
